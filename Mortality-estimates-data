Location for the data repository for the paper "Providing a detailed estimate of mortality using a simulation-based collision risk model" submitted to Plos One.

The data consists of output files and input files from the simulation-based approach to collision risk. 
The input files provide the full number of simualtions ran with the starting positions, animal and tidal speeds tested and run number for that individual simulation. 
The output files give the corresponding run number for the simulation alongside the location of the collision and the speed of that collision.
